                    About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? We could cause a diplomatic crisis.

                    Computer, lights up! I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.
